        "Take a look at the SAT scores of High School students over the year. The trend is worsening every year. These kids need help both on the subjects and personal development skills. All of which we can give them easily through anonymous guidance.",
        "Investors, there is currently a great demand in the market for a education technology system that will allow students to ask anonymous questions to a trusted adult on campus with only a username and password to authenticate their account with the school's access code. As you can see in our county's recent newspaper, many students do not have access to a great source of guidance. When asked, some either said it was hard to reach out for guidance while others said they were not comfortable showing up in person. Some of them would like to be anonymous while still being able to keep a line of conversation."

        "Hello, investors my name is Johnathan Doenathan. I have been a struggling student for many years until I was able to meet my friend, Peter. Together with him, we established a friend group that supported each other academically, mentally, and spiritually. I went from getting C's and D's to A's and B's. We're here to make things easier for other students to do the same thing: either seeking help anonymously with a trusted adult or fellow classmates. Get it done quick and move on with your day :D!!!"

Soon, more than the majority will have a VR headset. Technology should be here to help the new generation and make the old generation proud and impressed!. Investors, you have never heard of VR until 4 years ago. So now let's join me to creating a social networking app that is optimized for self-development and academics!"
